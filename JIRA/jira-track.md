# JIRA tracking

Due to I want to be a sde and to learn Kafka and Flink, I decide to track one Flink issue and one Kafka issue daily.

I also create a filter for tracking down issue watchers.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12350945

EXAMPLE:

project: 
jiraid: 
status: 
what happened?: 
what I can do: 
done?: 

## 2021-10

project: Flink
jiraid: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-24178

what happened?: someone finds out that Flink cannot find its TaskManager on kubernetes.
what I can do: Track what's going on
